Number Guessing Game

###
The code starts by importing the random module, which is used to generate a random number for the user to guess that number. The MIN_NUMBER and MAX_NUMBER variables set the range of numbers that can be guessed.

The game then prompts the user to make up to 6 guesses using a for loop. For each guess, the user enters their guess using the input() function, and the code checks if the guess is too low, too high, or correct.

If the user guesses correctly, the game congratulates them and breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, if the player uses all 6 guesses without guessing correctly, the game reveals the hidden number.

You can modify the MIN_NUMBER and MAX_NUMBER variables to adjust the range of numbers, and you can also modify the number of guesses allowed by changing the range of the for loop.
